# 🌍 GeoVector

A structured, extensible knowledge base for GeoGuessr players — built to help you learn, reason, and guess smarter using both meta clues and place-based insight.

This project is part open-source learning tool, part collaborative encyclopedia, and part experiment in structured geographic thinking.
